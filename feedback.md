## Lab Feedback

- Good work on the lab!
- Please make sure to put your Android Studio project in a seperate folder called `code` instead of in the base directory of the GitHub repository.
- When taking user input, you should clear the `EditText` field after the user presses submit. 
- Also, instead of setting the default text "Enter City Name", the `EditText` has a `hint` attribute that you can put this in, and the text will go away when the user starts typing, insteadd of them having to delete the default text before being able to enter what they want.
